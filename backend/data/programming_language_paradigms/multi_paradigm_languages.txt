Many modern languages support multiple paradigms to give developers flexibility.
Examples:
- Python: supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional styles
- JavaScript: supports imperative, functional, and event-driven programming
- Scala: blends object-oriented and functional features
Using multiple paradigms enables writing cleaner and more adaptable code.
