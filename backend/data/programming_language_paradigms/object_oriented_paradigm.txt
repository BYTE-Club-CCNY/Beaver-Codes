Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes code into objects that combine data and behavior.
Languages: Java, C++, Python
Core principles:
- Encapsulation: bundling data and methods
- Inheritance: reuse and extension of behavior
- Polymorphism: same interface, different implementations
- Abstraction: hide internal implementation details
