Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element is accessible by its index (zero-based).

Key Operations:
- Access: O(1)
- Insert/Delete (at end): O(1) if space allows
- Insert/Delete (at beginning or middle): O(n)

Arrays are ideal when frequent random access is needed, but resizing can be costly.
