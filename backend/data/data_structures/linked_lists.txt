Linked lists are dynamic, non-contiguous data structures made of nodes where each node stores data and a reference to the next node.

Types:
- Singly Linked List: one direction
- Doubly Linked List: two directions (next and prev)
- Circular Linked List: tail node links to head

Key Operations:
- Insertion/Deletion (at head): O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- No random access
