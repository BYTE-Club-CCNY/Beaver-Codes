Stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures. Elements are added and removed from the same end: the top.

Operations:
- push(x): Add x to top (O(1))
- pop(): Remove and return top (O(1))
- peek(): Return top without removing (O(1))

Applications:
- Function call stack
- Undo operations
- Expression parsing (infix â†’ postfix)
