Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defines the supported instructions of a CPU.
Types:
- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing): rich instruction set, e.g., x86
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing): simple instructions, e.g., ARM
Instructions include data movement, arithmetic, logical operations, and control flow.
