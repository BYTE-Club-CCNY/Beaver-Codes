Consistency models define the rules for visibility and ordering of updates.
Types:
- Strong consistency: all nodes see the same data instantly
- Eventual consistency: all nodes will converge eventually
- Causal consistency: respects cause-effect relationships
Used in distributed databases like Cassandra, DynamoDB, and MongoDB.
