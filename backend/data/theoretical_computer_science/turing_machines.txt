Turing Machines are abstract computational models introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. They form the foundation of the theory of computation.

A Turing Machine consists of:
- A finite set of states
- An infinite tape divided into cells
- A tape head that reads and writes symbols
- A transition function that dictates actions based on current state and tape symbol

Operations:
- Read symbol from tape
- Write a new symbol
- Move head left or right
- Change internal state

Turing Machines can simulate any algorithm and are used to define what is "computable." If a problem can be solved by a Turing Machine, it's considered Turing-computable.

Variants:
- Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM)
- Non-deterministic Turing Machine (NTM)
- Multi-tape and universal Turing Machines

The Church-Turing thesis posits that any function computable by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing Machine.
