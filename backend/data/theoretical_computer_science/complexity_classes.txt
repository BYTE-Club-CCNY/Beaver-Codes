Complexity theory classifies problems based on computational resources.
Important classes:
- P: Solvable in polynomial time
- NP: Verifiable in polynomial time
- NP-Complete: Hardest problems in NP (e.g., SAT)
- PSPACE: Solvable with polynomial memory
- EXP: Requires exponential time
Relationships among these classes are a central focus in computer science.
