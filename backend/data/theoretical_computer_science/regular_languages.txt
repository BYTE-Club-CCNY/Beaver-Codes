Regular languages are defined by regular expressions and finite automata.
Key properties:
- Closed under union, intersection, complement, and concatenation
- Can be described by DFAs, NFAs, and regular expressions
- Pumping Lemma is used to prove non-regularity
Examples: strings with even number of 0s, or strings ending in "01"
