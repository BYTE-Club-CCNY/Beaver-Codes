Computability theory studies what problems can or cannot be solved by algorithms.
Key concepts:
- Decidable problems: solvable by Turing Machines (e.g., string acceptance)
- Undecidable problems: no algorithm exists (e.g., Halting Problem)
- Reductions: transform one problem into another
- Recursive and recursively enumerable languages
